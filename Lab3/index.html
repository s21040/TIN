    <p>1. The <b>cat</b> (<i>Felis catus</i>) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a <b>house cat</b>, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.

        Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

    2. The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.

    <p>3. Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens.

        Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.

    <p>4.The origin of the English word <i>cat</i>, Old English cat, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.It was suggested that the word 'cattus' is derived from an Egyptian precursor of Coptic , "tomcat", or its feminine form suffixed with .
        The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska "wildcat" and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates. The Nubian word may be a loan from Arabic ~ . It is "equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic". The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sami gáđfi, "female stoat", and Hungarian hölgy, "lady, female stoat"; from Proto-Uralic <i>*käďwä</i>, "female (of a furred animal)".
